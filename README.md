Hello! Welcome to the development repository for S.Q.U.AIR - Sensor for the Quantitative Understanding of AIR.
What you need:
1. BW-16 RTL8720DN
2. PMS5003
3. BME-280
4. A few 10cm FM-FM Jumper Cables
5. The document called Easyinstructions.docx
6. A 3D printer, there are 2 .stl body files in the repos.
Enjoy! I still have the MQTT in the code but this is the basic idea and where I am with development. Would love any and all input - collaboration is key!
